# AI Agent Rules & Context for Kite (v2)

This document provides guidelines and architectural context for AI assistants and coding agents operating within the Kite repository.

## 🧠 System Context

*   **Project Purpose:** A web-like Terminal UI framework that uses a DOM, Flexbox layout, and standard event propagation to render rich TUIs.
*   **Tech Stack:** Go 1.26.1.
*   **Key Dependencies:** Charmbracelet ecosystem (`github.com/charmbracelet/ultraviolet`, `github.com/charmbracelet/colorprofile`), and `github.com/rivo/uniseg` for text shaping.
*   **Database/Storage:** None. The project operates purely in-memory.

## 🏛 Architectural Rules

1.  **Strict Package Isolation:**
    *   The `/dom` package models the logical tree only. It **must not** contain layout algorithms, computed styles, or drawing logic. Interactivity state (`Focusable()`, `Disabled()`) belongs strictly to the DOM.
    *   The `/style` package has **no dependencies** on other Kitex packages. Keep it isolated.
    *   State bridging happens via `/render` objects. DOM nodes point to a `render.Object`, but they do not own the rendering lifecycle; they only carry structural synchronization flags (`NeedsSync`, `ChildNeedsSync`).
2.  **Synchronize Phase (Pre-Layout):**
    *   The engine performs an explicit Sync Phase at the start of every frame.
    *   It walks the logical DOM tree and projects it into the render tree.
    *   Structural changes (insertions/removals) in the DOM trigger synchronization flags that propagate to the document root.
    *   The engine creates/removes `render.Box` or `render.Text` objects on the fly during this phase. There is no `render.Block` or `render.Flex`—the engine uses a unified `render.Box` which delegates to the appropriate algorithm at layout time based on `ComputedStyle.Display`.
    *   **Custom Render Objects:** Logical nodes can implement `render.CustomObjectProvider` to override the default creation logic and provide specialized render objects (e.g., for replaced elements like inputs).
3.  **Element Identity & Adoption:**
    *   Every `dom.Element` carries an `outer` back-pointer. This pointer ensures that when widgets wrap standard elements, functions like `event.Target()`, `GetElementByID()`, and `RenderObject.Node()` always return the outermost, user-visible wrapper.
    *   Do not reset the `outer` pointer to `nil` on detach. The identity must remain stable.
4.  **Styling Paradigm:**
    *   Always use the `Optional[T]` wrapper (e.g., `style.Some(val)`) when defining properties in `style.Style`. This distinguishes between a field that is explicitly unset versus a zero-value.
    *   The bridge to the rendering layer is `style.Computed`, which contains raw values (no optionals) after the resolver applies inheritance.
    *   The `style.Resolver` applies four cascade layers in order (weakest → strongest): inherited values, element-type defaults (`DefaultStyle()`), author styles (`RawStyle()`), UA-intrinsic styles (`IntrinsicStyle()`). See ADR-010.
    *   **UA-mandated styles must live on the element via `IntrinsicStyle()`. They must not be hard-coded in render objects.** Replaced and compound elements (e.g. `<input>`, `<textarea>`) override `IntrinsicStyle()` to return a sparse `style.Style` with properties such as `Display: InlineBlock` or `OverflowX: Clip` that authors cannot override.
5.  **Event Bubbling:**
    *   Events must strictly follow the Capture -> Target -> Bubble sequence. 
    *   Avoid introducing "IntentEvents" (a deprecated concept from v1). Rely on the `Synthesizer` to convert raw inputs into semantic events.
6.  **Inline Layout (LayoutNG):**
    *   Inline formatting contexts (IFC) must use a flat representation of `InlineItem`s rather than a recursive tree walk during line breaking.
    *   Text nodes must be collapsed and shaped before layout.
    *   `inline-block` elements are treated as atomic inlines that run their own block layout internally.
7.  **Flex Layout (LayoutNG):**
    *   Flex layout utilizes a two-pass approach (`FlexAlgorithm`): a measure pass to determine flex base sizes and a layout pass to resolve flexible lengths and alignment.
    *   All mutable state for the algorithm lives in `FlexLineBuilder` (`flex_builder.go`), which handles item collection, line chunking, flexible length resolution (freeze and restart), and axis alignment.
    *   The algorithm must use logical geometry (`MainSize`, `CrossSize`) to remain agnostic of the `flex-direction`.
    *   To maintain performance, the resolution loop must utilize the "freeze and restart" strategy for items hitting their min/max constraints, ensuring $O(N)$ or near-$O(N)$ complexity.
8.  **Focus Management:**
    *   Focus state and navigation logic operate strictly on the logical `dom.Node` tree.
    *   The `focus.Manager` uses the `dom.Focusable` and `dom.Disableable` interfaces to determine interactivity.
    *   Spatial navigation queries physical geometry by accessing the `RenderObject().Fragment()` of the logical nodes, rather than using the render tree as the primary source of truth for focus.
9.  **List Layout (Virtual Markers):**
    *   `ListAlgorithm` implements the `DisplayListItem` layout using a specialized two-column row layout.
    *   The marker is synthesized as a virtual, transient text fragment directly during layout (based on `ListStyleType`) to avoid creating phantom nodes in the render tree.
    *   Ordinal calculation for numbered lists uses an $O(N)$ sibling walk of the logical tree.
10. **Table Layout:**
    *   Table layout utilizes a two-pass approach (`TableAlgorithm`): a measurement pass to determine intrinsic grid column sizing (accounting for `ColSpan` and `RowSpan`), followed by a layout pass to resolve rows and place cells.
    *   All mutable state for the two passes lives in `TableFragmentBuilder` (`table_builder.go`), which handles section grouping, the `tableGrid` (including per-junction border-overlap flags), column min/max sizing, `DistributeSpan`, `ResolveWidths`, `AdjustRowOffset`, and `GetCellShift`.
    *   Cells act as independent block formatting contexts constrained by the rigid widths dictated by the parent table.
    *   Table routing is strictly driven by `style.DisplayTable`, `style.DisplayTableRow`, and `style.DisplayTableCell`. No specialized render nodes exist.
    *   **Implicit Border Collapse** — Kite tables always use border-collapse semantics. The coordinate rules are:
        *   Cells are placed at `(X=0, Y=0)` within the row (the `BoxFragmentBuilder`'s automatic `border.Top` inset is reset to `0`). This makes cell borders physically overlap with row borders at the same terminal pixel, allowing the paint engine's junction resolver to merge them.
        *   `GetCellShift` returns `1` when a cell's left border and the previous cell's right border both exist, shifting the new cell left by 1 so both borders share one terminal column.
        *   For **spanning cells** (`ColSpan > 1`), each `ColJunctionOverlap[j] == true` inside the span reduces `cellWidth` by 1 (the junction column does not exist inside a spanning cell).
        *   `AdjustRowOffset` returns `-1` when consecutive rows both have touching borders, collapsing them onto a single shared terminal row.
        *   The table width and distributable column budget are adjusted only for *actual* overlapping junctions (tracked in `tableGrid.ColJunctionOverlap`, `LeftEdgeHasOverlap`, `RightEdgeHasOverlap`), never unconditionally.
        *   When `LeftEdgeHasOverlap` is true, sections are placed at `X = padding.Left` (no left-border gap) and `childAvailWidth` is expanded so column 0 can share the table's left border column.
11. **UA Shadow Subtree (ADR-009):**
    *   Host elements (replaced or compound widgets) attach a closed UA shadow subtree via `Element.AttachUARoot(root)` in their constructor.
    *   **Public traversal APIs must never expose UA-subtree nodes.** `ChildNodes()`, `FirstChild()`, `LastChild()`, `Children()`, and `GetElementByID()` are always UA-invisible; author code has no path to reach UA internals.
    *   **Engine phases use `dom.LayoutChildren(n)`** (not `n.ChildNodes()`) to walk the union of public children and UA root's children. This iterator is the single authoritative walker for Sync, Style, Layout, and Paint; it must never be used in author-facing code.
    *   Every node in the UA subtree has its `self` back-pointer set to the host element (`setOuterRecursive`) so `event.Target()` and identity queries always collapse to the host (reuses ADR-0036).
    *   UA nodes must never implement `dom.Focusable`. `focus.Manager` uses the public `Children()` iterator and therefore inherently skips UA nodes — no focus-engine changes are needed.
    *   `dom.IsUANode(n)` reports `true` for any node stamped by `AttachUARoot`. O(1) via the `inUASubtree` flag on `baseNode`.
12. **Paint — Overflow Clipping (ADR-011):**
    *   `paint/engine.go::paintFragment` checks `ComputedStyle.OverflowX` / `OverflowY` after painting a fragment's own background and border. If either axis is non-`Visible`, it calls `surface.Clip(contentBoxRect)` and passes the returned sub-surface to the child recursion.
    *   A fragment's own background fill and border decoration are always painted onto the **unclipped** parent surface — a node's overflow property never clips its own border-box.
    *   For asymmetric overflow (one axis `Visible`, the other clipped), the clip rect spans the full surface extent on the `Visible` axis so that axis remains truly unconstrained.
    *   **`resolveBorders` invariant:** `PaintEngine.resolveBorders` is called exactly once, on the **root** `Surface`, after the full fragment tree has been painted. It must never be called on a clipped sub-surface, because the junction resolver must see the complete set of border cells across the entire viewport.
13. **Scroll Model (ADR-012):**
    *   Every `dom.Element` exposes `Scroll()`, `ScrollTo(x, y)`, and `ScrollBy(dx, dy)`.
    *   Scroll state is held in a lazy `*scrollState` pointer on the element, allocated only when needed.
    *   Programmatic scroll is valid on any element; however, paint only applies translation if the computed style indicates the element is a scroll container (`overflow: scroll` or `overflow: auto`).
    *   Paint **clamps on read**: the stored scroll offset is the raw author intent, which paint clamps to the actual content extent at render time.
    *   Mutating scroll marks the render object `DirtyScroll`. Paint clears this flag.

## 📋 Task Workflow

When the agent is assigned a task from `./tasks/task_list.md`, it **must** update that file's status row to **`In Progress`** as the very first action — before reading the task's Markdown file, before exploring the codebase, and before writing any code. Failing to do this is a workflow violation regardless of how well the implementation turns out.

At the **end** of every task the agent must also:

1. **Update the Concern → File Map** in this file if the task introduced a new file, deleted a file, renamed a file, or moved a concern to a different file. Every row in the map must remain accurate after the task completes.
2. **Keep `README.md` consistent** with any user-visible API or package changes.

## 🧑‍💻 Coding Conventions

1.  **Declarative UI API:**
    *   **Always** use the declarative functional constructors in the `element` package (e.g., `element.Box()`, `element.UL()`, `element.Span()`) when constructing UI trees.
    *   Avoid using manual `NewBox(doc)` or `AppendChild` calls unless you are implementing a new custom element type or low-level DOM logic.
    *   Leverage variadic children and automatic string boxing for concise UI code.
2.  **Continuous Documentation Maintenance:**
    *   **Always** keep `README.md` and `AGENT.md` up-to-date. If you introduce new packages, modify core architectural patterns, or change significant dependencies, you must update these files to reflect the new state of the project.
3.  **Modern Go Features:** 
    *   Utilize Go 1.24+ standard library features.
    *   Use iterators (`iter.Seq[T]`) for traversing collections, such as `Node.Children()`.
4.  **Interfaces and Embedding:** 
    *   Favor small, composable interfaces (e.g., `dom.Node`, `dom.Element`, `dom.TextNode`).
    *   When creating internal implementations, use unexported structs (e.g., `element`) and assert compile-time interface compliance (`var _ Element = (*element)(nil)`).
    *   **Stable interface assertions are mandatory for every public interface implementor.** Every concrete type that satisfies a public interface must carry a `var _ InterfaceName = (*ConcreteType)(nil)` guard at package scope — not just the ones that seem tricky. This ensures the compiler catches broken contracts immediately rather than at the call site.
5.  **Documentation:** 
    *   All packages must contain a `doc.go` file summarizing the package's responsibility.
    *   Reference ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) in docstrings when touching core mechanics (e.g., `ADR-0036` for DOM adoption).

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

1.  **Table-Driven Tests:** Prefer table-driven structures using the standard `testing` package.
2.  **Mocking:** Use the `backend/mock` package for testing the Render and Paint pipelines without requiring a physical TTY or terminal emulator.
3.  **Benchmarks:** Any changes to `/layout`, `/style` resolving, or `/paint` logic must be accompanied by `testing.B` benchmarks, as performance is critical in a 60FPS UI loop.
4.  **No Panics:** Ensure test assertions do not result in raw panics. Handled disconnected/nil states gracefully in DOM manipulation tests.
5.  **Always run tests with a timeout:** Use `go test -timeout 30s ./...` (or a per-package equivalent) so that a deadlock or hung goroutine causes a clean failure instead of blocking the terminal indefinitely. Never invoke `go test` without `-timeout`.
6.  **Regression file headers:** Every file under `tests/regressions/` must begin with a package-level comment that states which component(s) it covers and the originating task or bug. Use this format:
    ```go
    // Regression tests for <ComponentName> — covers <TSK-XXX / brief description>.
    ```
This makes it immediately clear which source files are relevant without reading the test bodies.
